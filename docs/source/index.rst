Welcome to Splango's documentation!
===================================

Splango is a project intended to help developers do split-testing in
Django websites.

Splango is designed to help you take the first steps with split (A/B) testing
with minimal friction. It allows you to instantly declare and run a split test
experiment in your templates or in Python code, and provides an admin UI for
viewing simple funnel reports on the results.
